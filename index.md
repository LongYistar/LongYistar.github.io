## Research Interests

- Built environment, Travel behavior, Agent-based modeling, Applied machine learning, Resilience

- Research 1 **Built environment and travel behaviour**: 
- Uses machine learning technology and Agent-based modeling (ABM) to study the nonlinear relationship between built environment and travel behavior.
- Research 2 **Travel behaviour resilience under disasters**: 
- We intend to analyse the travel behaviour resilience under disasters through large-scale data, and explore the travel patterns and their coping strategies under disaster situations.
- Research 3 **Built environment, EV charging infrastructure, and urban energy resilience**:
- This research focuses on enhancing urban energy resilience by linking the built environment with electric vehicle charging infrastructure and adopting cross-sectoral system optimization to support low-carbon and sustainable urban development.
