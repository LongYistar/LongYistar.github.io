## Research Interests

- Built environment
- Travel behavior
- Agent-based modeling
- Applied Machine Learning
- [My latest research proposal](https://caihanlin.com/file/.pdf)ðŸ”—

My present research delves into the intricate interplay between the constructed environment and the everyday travel habits of children.  I am deeply engaged in exploring the applications of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** within the realm of **Children's Travel Behavior**.  In essence, sophisticated technologies such as ML and ABM have a profound impact on everyone's lives by reshaping our understanding of the built environment and its effects on children's travel patterns. I am committed to dedicating my expertise to this significant endeavor, aiming to enhance societal well-being through my research and its applications.
